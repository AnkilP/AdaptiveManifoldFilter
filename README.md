AdaptiveManifoldFilter
======================

C++ (OpenCV) implementation of the adaptive manifold high dimensional filter described in the paper:
* Eduardo S. L. Gastal and Manuel M. Oliveira. Adaptive Manifolds for Real-Time High-Dimensional Filtering.

This code is based on reference implementation from:
